# Quick demonstration

I wanted to show what data analysis looks like with Julia, so made a quick analysis with detecting clicks.

I took the Sperm whales codas creaks from sound cloud, and cut the last 5 seconds of clicks out of it - with full length it would be cumbersome to plot everything.

You can read through the file, and reference plots here.
